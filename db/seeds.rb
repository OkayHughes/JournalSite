"Background and aim

The World Health Organisation Study Group on Tobacco Product Regulation (TobReg) has issued in 2005 an \"Advisory Note\" entitled: \"Waterpipe Tobacco Smoking: Health Effects, Research Needs and Recommended Actions by Regulators\". \"Waterpipe\" smoking is now considered a global public health threat and the corresponding artefact is actually known in the world under three main terms: hookah, narghile and shisha. This important report, the first ever prepared by WHO on the subject, poses two major problems. On one hand, its bibliographical references dismiss world chief relevant studies. On the other, it contains a certain number of errors of many orders: biomedical, sociological, anthropological and historical. The purpose of the present study is to highlight, one by one, where these weaknesses and errors lie and show how this official report can be considerably improved.
Results

We realise that widely advertised early anthropological studies were not taken into consideration whereas they shed a substantial light on this peculiar form of smoking and help understanding its high complexity. As for concrete errors to be found in this report, they deal with the chemistry of smoke, health-related effects, smoking patterns, description and history of the artefact and its use, gender and underage use aspects, prevention and research needs in this field.
Conclusion

The scientific credibility of an international expert report may be at stake if its recommendations do not rely on sound objective research findings and a comprehensive review of the existing literature. The critical comments in this study will certainly help improve the present WHO report.",

"Background

Stevia rebaudiana Bertoni is an important anti-diabetic medicinal herb containing non-caloric sweet compounds. In this study, the effect of gamma irradiation on growth kinetics and accumulation of various bioactive compounds were investigated during callogenesis.

Results

Callus was developed from leaf pieces inoculated on Murashige and Skoog (MS) medium containing combination of 6-benzyladenine (BA; 1.0 mg l−1), α-naphthalene acetic acid (NAA), indole butyric acid (IBA) and gibberellic acid (GA3; 0.3 mg l−1). After 30-days, vigorous calli were transferred to fresh medium and exposed to various gamma irradiations (5.0, 10, 15 and 20 Gy). It has been observed that the increasing doses of gamma rays inhibited callus proliferation (88.61–79.16%) as compared to control (95.83%). Similarly, 10, 15 and 20 Gy doses induced friable, granular and spongy callus as compared to control (compact). Furthermore, 5.0, 10 and 20 Gy doses significantly reduced the fresh callus biomass (FCB), however, 15 Gy dose enhanced FCB (1660 mg) and dry callus biomass (DCB; 159.36 mg) than control (1520; 145.92 mg). The chromatographic data revealed that 15 Gy dose slightly enhanced stevioside content (0.251 mg/g-DCB) than control (0.232 mg/g-DW), while other doses showed a negative effect on stevioside content. Higher antioxidant activity (88.73%) was observed in 20 Gy treated callus cultures. However, higher total phenolic content (TPC; 43.90 mg/g DCB) and total flavonoids content (TFC; 6.87 mg/g DCB) were observed in 15 Gy treated callus cultures.

Conclusions

The application of gamma irradiation did not show major variation in biomass and bioactive compounds production in callus cultures of S. rebaudiana.",

               authors:"Lee A. Hadwiger,Ming-Mei Chang",
               journal:"New Negatives in Plant Science",
               abstract:"Background

Scientific efforts directed toward improving the defense of plants to pathogens are dependent on knowing how the defense responses are signaled. In general a given plant can resist essentially all challenging pathogens except for the true pathogens which have developed means to suppress or evade the plant's “non-host” resistance response. Thus understanding the signaling of this potent level of immunity is paramount.

Findings

The initiation of transcription of defense genes associated with non-host resistance responses in plants has been hypothesized both as the direct targeting of DNA (chromatin) and as an indirect activation of transcription factors following a PAMP (effector)/PRR (receptor) recognition. Documentation exists for both routes and this report evaluates two PAMPs in the pea endocarp system in which DNA damage has been proposed to directly initiate defense gene transcription. The induction of immune responses resulting from direct effects on chromatin has not received the attention warranted. To account for flexibility in initiating transcription of defense genes, the plant must be responsive to challenges by every organism and all biological elicitors. The PAMP/PRR hypothesis is visualized as families of pattern recognition receptor proteins localized mainly in the cell membrane that become bound with effectors thereby cascading a signal to specified transcription factors. Direct challenges from nuclear penetrating elicitors in the pea non-host resistance system are visualized as causing an unlimited diversity of structural changes to chromosomal regions in the vicinity of plant non-host defense genes and subsequently enhancing their transcription. This report further evaluates the action of candidate PAMPs; flg22 from bacteria and chitin from fungi, in signaling the non-host resistance response of peas.

Conclusions

The results indicate that these PAMPs only marginally elicit pisatin production compared with challenges containing intact fungal spore suspensions. High external conc. of the PAMPs activated both a set of PR (pathogeneses-related) genes and developed cytological-detectable disease resistance against a true pea pathogen. The failure of lower concentrations of chitinous treatments to activate cytological detectable disease resistance, PR gene induction or pisatin accumulations suggests the existence of additional signaling routes to the non-host disease resistance generated by intact fungal spores. DNA damage to the pea DNA was detected indicating direct effects from PAMPs on the chromatin occur. Only high concentration levels of these PAMPs appear to have the potential to constitute a portion of those signals generating responses in peas against the vast arsenals of microbes in nature.",

               authors:"Brian Charles Baculis,Carlos Fernando Valenzuela",
               journal:"Journal of Negative Results in BioMedicine",
               abstract:
"Background

Ethanol exposure during the rodent equivalent to the 3rd trimester of human pregnancy (i.e., first 1–2 weeks of neonatal life) has been shown to produce structural and functional alterations in the CA3 hippocampal sub-region, which is involved in associative memory. Synaptic plasticity mechanisms dependent on retrograde release of brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) driven by activation of L-type voltage-gated Ca2+ channels (L-VGCCs) are thought to play a role in stabilization of both GABAergic and glutamatergic synapses in CA3 pyramidal neurons. We previously showed that ethanol exposure during the first week of life blocks BDNF/L-VGCC-dependent long-term potentiation of GABAA receptor-mediated synaptic transmission in these neurons. Here, we tested whether this effect is associated with lasting alterations in GABAergic and glutamatergic transmission.

Methods

Rats were exposed to air or ethanol for 3 h/day between postnatal days three and five in vapor inhalation chambers, a paradigm that produces peak serum ethanol levels near 0.3 g/dl. Whole-cell patch-clamp electrophysiological recordings of spontaneous inhibitory and excitatory postsynaptic currents (sIPSCs and sEPSCs, respectively) were obtained from CA3 pyramidal neurons in coronal brain slices prepared at postnatal days 13–17.

Results

Ethanol exposure did not significantly affect the frequency, amplitude, rise-time and half-width of either sIPSCs or sEPSCs.

Conclusions

We show that an ethanol exposure paradigm known to inhibit synaptic plasticity mechanisms that may participate in the stabilization of GABAergic and glutamatergic synapses in CA3 pyramidal neurons does not produce lasting functional alterations in these synapses, suggesting that compensatory mechanisms restored the balance of excitatory and inhibitory synaptic transmission.

"Background

Randomised controlled trials have shown an excellent preventive effect of statins on ischemic heart disease. Our objective was to investigate if a relation can be detected between acute myocardial infarction- (AMI) mortality or incidence and statin utilisation, for men and women in different age-groups on a population basis.
Results

The utilisation rate of statins increased almost three times for both men and women between 1998 and 2002. During 1998-2000 the incidence of AMI decreased clearly for men but only slightly for women. Mortality decreased from 1998 to 2002. The change in statin utilisation from 1998 to 2000 showed no correlation to the change in AMI mortality from 2000 to 2002. Statin utilisation and AMI- incidence or mortality showed no correlations when adjusting for socio-economic deprivation, antidiabetic drugs and geographic coordinates.
Conclusions

Despite a widespread and increasing utilisation of statins, no correlation to the incidence or mortality of AMI could be detected. Other factors than increased statin treatment should be analysed especially when discussing the allocation of public resources.",

Objective: The aim was to study the role of losartan on cisplatin (CP)-induced nephrotoxicity in an estradiol replacement rat model. 

Materials and Methods: Forty-seven female Wistar rats were ovariectomized and divided into seven groups. Groups 1 and 2 were treated with placebo (sesame oil) on a weekly basis for 4 weeks, and then they received saline or CP (2.5 mg/kg/day) for the next 7 days, respectively. Group 3 received estradiol (250 μg/kg/week) for 4 weeks, and then treated with losartan (10 mg/kg/day) for the next 10 days while from day 3; they also received CP for 7 days. Group 4 had treatment regimen the same as Group 3, except saline instead of losartan. Groups 5 and 6 were treated similar to Groups 3 and 4, respectively, but the dose of estradiol was doubled. Finally, Group 7 was treated as Group 3 except vehicle instead of estradiol. At the end of the experiment, blood samples were obtained to measure blood urea nitrogen (BUN), creatinine (Cr), nitric oxide metabolite (nitrite) and malondialdehyde (MDA). The kidney tissues were also subjected to pathology investigations. 

Results: Cisplatin significantly increased the serum level of BUN, Cr, and MDA (P < 0.05). CP also increased kidney weight (KW) and kidney tissue damage score (KTDS), and decreased bodyweight significantly (P < 0.05). There is a significant difference in KTDS, weight changes and serum level of MDA between positive control groups compared with the groups received combination of losartan and CP (P < 0.05). Conclusions: It seems that the estrogen could promote CP-induced nephrotoxicity. Losartan also did not intensify CP-induced nephrotoxicity. Accordingly, supplementation of losartan to attenuate CP-induced nephrotoxicity in ovariectomized model treated with estradiol is not suggested.",

               abstract:
"Background: The cysteine protease, falcipain-2 (FP-2) is an important drug target for the management of infection by the human malaria parasite Plasmodium falciparum. The rapid emergence of resistance is the main problem with all antimalarial agents. Hence, the discovery of novel, effective drugs to counter the spread of malaria parasites that are resistant toward existing agents, especially drugs that can act on new targets, is urgently necessary. 

Materials and Methods: A novel series of 2-(4-(substituted benzoyl) piperazine-1-yl)-N-phenylacetamide derivatives was designed using the ligand-based approach, employing a three-point pharmacophore model. It consists of an aromatic group (monocyclic/bicyclic), which is attached to the hydrophobic moiety; commonly an aromatic residue through hydrogen bond donor (HBD) and hydrogen bond acceptor (HBA) atom(s) acting as the linker. The new chemical entities were synthesized from the key intermediate N-phenyl-2-(piperazine-1-yl) acetamide, by coupling it with various substituted acids in the presence of 1-(3-dimethylaminopropyl)-3-ethylcarbodiimide hydrochloride (EDC.HCl) and 1 hydroxybenzotriazole (HOBt). The obtained compounds' structures were confirmed by 1 H NMR and by mass spectral data. 

Results: All the synthesized compounds were evaluated for their in vitro FP-2 inhibitory activity. Two compounds 5l and 5q showed very weak enzyme inhibition activities (3-5%) and the remaining 15 compounds showed no inhibition at 10 μm concentrations. However, unlike other reported FP-2 inhibitors, none of these molecules showed potent activity. Conclusion: This series of compounds did not have or had very less antimalarial activity.",

In this research, climate indices, such as the North Atlantic Oscillation, are taken as proxies of the external modulator. In our reply to the criticism raised by Scott and Grant (2004) we first review achievements of “visibility” research and then place their critique against the findings in “visibility” research. The agenda of “visibility” research is to seek the conditions (population processes, noise structure that are components less well known in real life) under which the presence of an external modulator is visible in the population time series. It turns out that the external noise is visible in the population dynamics only when the underlying deterministic kernel of the dynamics is locally stable. Four different ways of scoring the noise visibility give largely matching results under temporally structured noise.",

The presence of models simulating a predation risk for insect visitors did not affect fruit set. Characteristics of the plant’s reproductive system, such as self-compatibility, local availability of visitors, and visitor behavior regulate the outcome of these interactions, potentially explaining the results obtained. For instance, regardless of the number of cross-pollination events - which are influenced by the presence of model spiders - the number of fruits remains unchanged because of self-pollination events. Moreover, this type of interaction requires the availability of a particular group of species in the community (i.e., a specific plant and its pollinators, which in turn have specific predators) - a combination of elements expected to render this occurrence uncommon. Trophic cascade effects caused by the presence of carnivores may therefore end up being overestimated due the lack of reports that describe the absence of this effect, which could biases our expectations about the generality of this kind of effect in nature.",
